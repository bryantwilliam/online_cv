                <h2>Junior Mobile Software Engineer<span>From 12/2023 to present</span></h2>
                <u><b>Atomic.io</b> - Wellington, New Zealand</u>
                <p>
                    After completing an internship at Atomic.io in the SDK team, I was promoted and named the "product owner of 
                    our <span class="skill">Flutter</span> SDK" by my manager - from then on, I was the sole engineer working on this project throughout 
                    my employement. Atomic's Flutter SDK served as a wrapper for their <span class="skill">native Android and iOS</span> SDKs, requiring me 
                    to work with a combination of 
                    <span class="skill">Dart</span>, 
                    <span class="skill">Objective-C</span>, and <span class="skill">Kotlin</span>. Later, I attended an important in-person meeting with one of 
                    New Zealand's major investment firms, who ended up adopting my Flutter SDK.
                    <br/>
                    Moreover, I worked extensively on Atomic's iOS SDK, alongside a senior engineer, 
                    who was an amazing mentor. I also created our Flutter SDK's <span class="skill">Github</span> automatic 
                    <span class="skill">release process</span> by myself from 
                    the ground up, using <span class="skill">Circle-CI</span> and <span class="skill">Fastlane</span>. 
                    <br/>
                    In addition to my core SDK work, 
                    I worked with <span class="skill">generative AI APIs</span>, including <span class="skill">advanced RAG</span> techniques and
                    <span class="skill">vector databases/embeddings</span> to create a proof of concept chatbot and
                    card UI generator from image prompts - an innovation that won Atomic's internal AI hackathon and inspired a planned feature. Additionally, 
                    I directly consulted one-on-one with the CTO, to help shape Atomic.io's new <span class="skill">Artificial Intelligence</span> strategy. 
                </p>
                <br/>

                <h2>Mobile Software Engineer Intern<span>From 11/2023 to 12/2023</span></h2>
                <u><b>Atomic.io</b> - Wellington, New Zealand</u>
                <p>
                    Within a few weeks as an intern, I wrote documentation, independently created a demo app for 
                    customers using Flutter (<span class="skill">Riverpod</span> state management), 
                    and became familiar with Atomic's SDKs.

                <u><b>Auckland Home Staging</b> - Auckland, New Zealand</u>
                <p>
                    At Auckland Home Staging, I was responsible for arranging and moving furniture between houses. 
                    There were occasions when clients would show up at the house, and I was expected to engage with them 
                    in a friendly manner. I also needed to maintain a professional demeanour, as 
                    my behaviour on the job directly impacted the business' image and reputation.

            <dt>Other experience</dt>
            <dd>
                In addition to my employment history, over the past 10+ years, I have gained a large amount of practical experience in full-stack 
                programming - as evidenced by the 50+ public projects and 20+ private projects on my Github profile. 
                During high school, I learnt a myriad of different programming languages and frameworks. In addition, I used 
                <span class="skill">Linux</span> as my main operating system for 4 years (Arch, Debian, etc).
                <br/>
                My biggest strength is <span class="skill">mobile development</span>, particularly Flutter. But I have dipped my toes in many areas, 
                and can pick up new 
                technologies quickly, as demonstrated by my rapid adoption of Objective-C and Kotlin during my early tenure at Atomic.io.
                <br/>
                This year in my spare time outside work, I have been working on a massive Flutter project. This project is <span class="skill">full-stack</span>, and comprises a <span class="skill">mobile app</span>, 
                <span class="skill">web app</span>, and <span class="skill">browser extension</span>. 
                It uses <span class="skill">Firebase</span> as the <span class="skill">backend</span>, with Firestore (a 
                <span class="skill">NoSQL database</span>) and 
                <span class="skill">Cloud Functions</span> (both <span class="skill">Node.js</span> and <span class="skill">Python</span>). It also uses
                generative AI with a RAG. Furthermore, the 
                browser extension is made using <span class="skill">HTML</span>, <span class="skill">Javascript</span> and Flutter
                (with <span class="skill">Javascript-Dart interop</span>), and does things like <span class="skill">web scraping</span> and 
                advanced article extraction techniques. I am very proud of this project, and I plan to release it soon.
                I would love to show a demo of it in an interview, if I get the chance. 
                <br/>
                I am passionate about about <span class="skill">software architecture</span>, having implemented 
                <span class="skill">MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)</span> 
                in Flutter while working at Atomic.io, and in my own projects, a layered architecture with Riverpod that combines principles from 
                <span class="skill">DDD (Domain-Driven Design)</span> and 
                <span class="skill">Clean Architecture</span>. I also have experience with <span class="skill">MVP (Model–view–presenter)</span>, 
                which I implemented in Atomic.io's native iOS SDK using Objective-C.
                <br/>

                    the AWS Cloud day event and through a workshop provided by Atomic.

                        at university, and I put them into

                        mobile implementation of object detection and measurement of infants in 2D images - the topic
                        was chosen by my supervisor. I also developed a 
                        proof-of-concept mobile 
                        app using
                        Flutter+Dart: <a href="https://github.com/bryantwilliam/baby_measure">
                            github.com/bryantwilliam/baby_measure</a>. This project also achieved an A grade.

                <p>
                    I was honoured to receive the <b>"Best Teamwork" Award</b> during the Create Camp event (2023) hosted by 
                    Summer of Tech. My team's mentor, who closely observed our progress, commended my communication skills, 
                    my willingness to help others and my leadership acumen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also played various sports throughout my life, which have taught me empathy, active listening, 
                    and clear communication.
                    Furthermore, I approach my individual software work holistically, considering the team's goals, values,
                    and stakeholder interests. For example, I make well-thought-out micro-decisions that may 
                     impact the business, and I strive to write code that other team members can easily read, review or maintain.

                     updating my knowledge through online learning and hobby coding projects.
