                <u><b>Atomic.io</b> - Wellington, New Zealand</u>
                <p>
                    Atomic.io is a SaaS company that provides SDKs for developers to integrate into their applications. Within one week, I independently created a complex Flutter demo app from scratch to showcase Atomic.io's Flutter SDK to clients. 
                    For this app, I decided to use DDD architecture and Riverpod state management.
                    Additionally, I:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Created a 10-minute video tutorial for clients, narrating how the code works.</li>
                    <li>Made changes to their client-facing SDK documentation, including editing HTML, markdown, and CSS files.</li>
                    <li>Worked on their Flutter SDK, which involves wrapping native iOS and Android SDKs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    I have been working at Atomic.io for around 3 weeks and have made several successful pull requests and bug fixes. My team lead praised the speed and quality of my Flutter software engineering execution after the first two weeks.

                <p>
                    At Auckland Home Staging, I was responsible for arranging and moving furniture between houses. 
                    There were occasions when clients would show up at the house, and I was expected to engage with them 
                    in a friendly manner. I also needed to maintain a professional demeanour, as 
                    my behaviour on the job directly impacted the business' image and reputation.

                <p>
                    During high school, I participated in my school's gateway programme and worked unpaid for a week at 
                    PB Tech. This experience introduced me to my first workplace, providing me with valuable work 
                    communication skills and the opportunity to collaborate with other employees. My primary tasks involved 
                    assembling computers and packing computer parts into boxes.

                Over the past 10+ years, I have gained practical experience in full-stack programming as a
                hobbyist - as evidenced by the 50+ public projects and 10+ private projects on my 
                <span class="skill">Github</span> profile.
                During high school, I learnt a myriad of different programming languages and frameworks. In
                addition, I used 
                <span class="skill">Linux</span> 
                as my main operating system for 4 years (Arch, Debian, etc).
                <br/>
                I am currently focusing mostly on 
                <span class="skill">mobile development</span>, 
                <span class="skill">Firebase</span> (<span class="skill">Firestore</span> key-value <span class="skill">NoSQL</span> database, <span class="skill">Node.js</span> for <span class="skill">Cloud Functions</span>, etc), 
                <span class="skill">Java</span> and 
                <span class="skill">Flutter</span>. I have many recent apps on my Github using Flutter and I tend to follow <span class="skill">Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</span> architecture with <span class="skill">Riverpod</span> state management. 
                However, I am still proficient in a wide variety of other platforms, 
                frameworks, and programming languages.

                        at university, and I put them into
                        practice with a few group projects. For my final bachelor's degree group project, 
                        my group chose me as the "product owner" in a <span class="skill">Scrum</span>-based team, and we
                         achieved an A 
                        grade. 
                        This project used Java, <span class="skill">Android SDK</span>, an <span class="skill">AWS IoT REST 
                            API</span>, 
                        and a <span class="skill">Google Cloud</span> library. I also set up <span class="skill">unit

                        over the years. Moreover, Flutter is a cross-platform framework, so I can also use it to build

                <h2>Team Player</h2>
                <p>
                    I was honoured to receive the <b>"Best Teamwork" Award</b> during the Create Camp event (2023) hosted by 
                    Summer of Tech. My team's mentor, who closely observed our progress, commended my communication skills, 
                    my willingness to help others and my leadership acumen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also played various sports throughout my life, which have taught me empathy, active listening, 
                    and clear communication.
                    Furthermore, I approach my individual software work holistically, considering the team's goals, values,
                    and stakeholder interests. For example, I make well-thought-out micro-decisions that may 
                     impact the business, and I strive to write code that other team members can easily read and maintain.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Problem solving and critical thinking</h2>
                <p>
                    I find great satisfaction in tackling complex problems through rigorous critical thinking, whether it 
                    be analyzing each edge case of code, debugging, or planning out a logical flow. Additionally, I am 
                    naturally thorough and resilient when solving challenging software-related problems.
                </p>
